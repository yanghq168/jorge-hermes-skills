# Cron Job Debugging

Hermes cron jobs can fail silently — the scheduler writes a markdown report to
`~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<timestamp>.md`, but nothing surfaces in the
main conversation until the user notices a job isn't delivering. This skill
covers the diagnostic loop and the most common fixes.

## When to use

Load this skill when the user reports any of:
- "My scheduled job isn't running"
- "The [X] cron is failing"
- "I never got the [daily/weekly] digest"
- A no-agent script-mode job that was supposed to run at a specific time but produced nothing
- A scheduler output log file with `Status: script failed`

## The diagnostic loop (5 steps)

When a cron job is misbehaving, always run this loop in order. Don't skip
straight to "the script must be broken" — Hermes cron has its own failure
modes that don't surface until you read the output log.

### 1. List jobs and find the ID

```bash
hermes cron list
# or for cronjob tool user: cronjob(action='list')
```

Record the `job_id` (e.g. `077158d603ec`) and the configured `schedule`.

### 2. Read the most recent output log

Output logs are the source of truth for silent failures:

```bash
ls ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/ | tail -5
cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<most-recent>.md
```

The log header always includes:
- `Job ID`, `Run Time`, `Mode` (agent vs `no_agent (script)`), `Status`

If `Status: script failed`, the **body of the log is the error message** — don't
just glance at the header.

### 3. Decode the common errors

| Log body | Meaning | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `Script not found: <path>` | Scheduler couldn't find the script | See "Script-path resolution" below |
| (empty body, agent mode) | The LLM hit an error before producing output | Re-run with `cronjob(action='run')` and watch stderr |
| Non-zero exit code | Script crashed | Run the script manually to see the traceback |
| (no log file at all) | Job didn't tick — scheduler down or paused | `hermes cron status` |
| Log says success but delivery failed | Job ran but couldn't reach the target | Check `delivery` config + target chat/channel |
| `Connection unexpectedly closed` / `SMTPServerDisconnected` | Almost always a **credential/transport failure**, not a network blip | See "SMTP/credential failure deep-dive" below |
| `535 Login fail` / `535 Authentication failed` | SMTP auth code / password is wrong or expired | See "SMTP/credential failure deep-dive" below |

### 4. Apply the Script-path resolution rule

**The most common silent-failure cause.** When you create or update a cron job
with `script=some/relative/path.sh`, the scheduler resolves it relative to
`~/.hermes/scripts/` (the Hermes scripts dir), NOT the directory the script
lives in. So a script at `~/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh` entered as
`script="cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh"` is looked for at
`~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh` — which doesn't exist.

Diagnose by computing the expected path the scheduler uses and comparing it
to where the script actually lives:

```bash
HERMES_SCRIPTS="${HOME}/.hermes/scripts"
SCHED_PATH="$HERMES_SCRIPTS/<what-you-entered-as-script-field>"
ACTUAL="$(find ~/.hermes -name '<script-name>' -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
echo "Scheduler looks at: $SCHED_PATH"
echo "Script actually at: $ACTUAL"
```

**Three fixes, pick whichever is cleanest for the deployment:**

1. **Change the cron job's `script` field to the absolute path** (preferred —
   survives refactors):
   ```python
   cronjob(action='update', job_id='<id>', script='/home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh')
   ```
2. **Symlink the scheduler's expected path to the real one:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts
   ln -sf /home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh \
          ~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh
   ```
3. **Move the script to the scheduler's expected location** (only if option 1
   and 2 don't fit).

Always re-run the job once after the fix:
```bash
hermes cron run <job_id>
cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<newest>.md   # confirm success
```

### 5. SMTP / credential failure deep-dive (delivery-side silent failures)

The other common silent-failure class: the script runs, prints `❌ 发送失败: Connection unexpectedly closed`, exits 0 — and nothing reaches the inbox. The cryptic "connection closed" hides the real cause (almost always auth).

**The trap**: Python's `smtplib` re-raises the server's *post-AUTH* socket teardown as a generic `SMTPServerDisconnected("Connection unexpectedly closed")`. The real rejection is buried in the server transcript a few lines earlier. You cannot see it from the script's stdout.

**Step 1 — Reproduce with debug output to surface the real error:**

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/cron/scripts
python3 -c "
import smtplib, socket
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
socket.setdefaulttimeout(30)
smtplib.SMTP.debuglevel = 1
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('<smtp_server>', 465, timeout=30) as s:
    s.login('<user>', '<pass>')
    s.sendmail('<user>', '<to>', 'Subject: t\n\ntest')
"
```

Look at the `reply:` lines. The smoking gun is one of:

- `535 Login fail. Account is abnormal, service is not open, password is incorrect, login frequency limited...` — **auth code/password is wrong, expired, or service not enabled**. Cannot be fixed remotely; user must log into the mail provider's web UI and regenerate.
- `550 Mailbox not found` / `User not found` — recipient address wrong, or sender not authorized to send as that address.
- `554 DT:SPM ...` (QQ specific) — message body rejected as spam; shorten subject, remove URL shorteners, or fix plain-text/HTML mismatch.
- `454 4.7.0 Too many login attempts` — rate-limited; back off and try later, or stop running the script from multiple places.

**⚠️ QQ Mail silent-reject variant (no 535 in transcript):** When QQ's anti-spam system has aggressively revoked an auth code, the server may close the TLS socket IMMEDIATELY after `AUTH` with NO `reply:` line at all — `debuglevel=1` will show a clean `EHLO 250` then a bare `SMTPServerDisconnected` with no `535` between them. This is indistinguishable from a network drop except by the pattern: SSL handshake + EHLO succeed + AUTH never gets a reply → credential revoked by aggressive anti-spam (not just expired). Same user fix (regenerate in QQ web UI), but the diagnostic signature is different — don't conclude "network issue" just because the 535 line is missing. Confirm by trying port 587 STARTTLS as well: if EHLO succeeds there too and AUTH dies silently, it's the same silent-reject. If port 587 hangs at connect, you have a real firewall/network problem instead.

**Faster path — run `scripts/probe_smtp.py`** instead of retyping the debuglevel recipe. It auto-detects which credential sources this Hermes deployment uses (`config.yaml` + `~/.hermes/.env`), runs both 465-SSL and 587-STARTTLS probes, and reports which of the three failure modes you're in: 535-in-transcript (Case A), no-reply-silent-reject (Case B), or connect-time failure (Case C). Exit 0 = auth dead, exit 1 = real network problem. See `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md` for the full Case B transcript.

**Step 2 — Verify the credential actually matches what's stored.** Cron scripts read from `~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml` (via the standard `config_loader.py`). They do NOT inherit your interactive shell's env vars. So if your working theory is "the env-var auth code works but the YAML one doesn't" — check both:

```bash
# What's in the config file
grep -A1 smtp_pass ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml
# What's in the env (if the script reads os.environ)
env | grep -iE "smtp|auth_code|mail_pass"
# Which one is the script actually using?
grep -nE "smtp_pass|os\.environ|SMTP_PASS" ~/.hermes/cron/scripts/<script>.py | head
```

In Hermes' standard pattern (`from config_loader import get_mail_config`), the YAML wins over env. If both are wrong, the fix is the YAML; env vars are only a fallback inside the `try/except ImportError` block.

**Step 3 — Try the alternate transport.** Port 465 (SMTPS/SSL) and port 587 (STARTTLS) are independent — one can be blocked by the host firewall while the other works. If 465 fails, retry with `smtplib.SMTP('host', 587)` + `.starttls()`. If both fail with the same `535`, the credential is dead regardless of transport.

**Step 4 — Save locally as a fallback so today's content isn't lost.** While waiting for the user to fix the credential, persist the generated output so the article/digest is still recoverable:

```python
# Inside the cron script's main(), BEFORE send_email(), or in a wrapper:
import os
from datetime import datetime
out_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/output')
os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok=True)
ts = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M')
with open(f'{out_dir}/<script>_{ts}.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(full_html)
with open(f'{out_dir}/<script>_{ts}.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(plain_text)
```

Then in the failure report, point the user at the saved file. This is the difference between "today's content is gone" and "today's content is on disk, please fix auth."

### 6. Tiered fallback: retry transient, then save locally on hard failure

Step 4's "save before send" is the right pattern for content that takes a long time to generate. But most cron scripts already have the content in memory by the time they call `send_email()`, and saving-then-attempting-then-re-saving-on-failure is two writes of the same bytes. A tighter pattern that works well in practice:

**a. Retry transient `SMTPServerDisconnected` once with a 3s backoff.** Most 535 / socket-teardown failures are NOT transient — but a real network blip looks identical to a credential failure from the script's side. One cheap retry distinguishes them and recovers the rare real-blip case without hiding real auth failures.

```python
import time
last_err = None
for attempt in range(2):
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, timeout=15) as server:
            server.login(SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS)
            server.sendmail(SMTP_USER, TO_EMAIL, msg.as_string())
        return True, "发送成功"
    except (smtplib.SMTPServerDisconnected, smtplib.SMTPException, OSError) as e:
        last_err = e
        if attempt == 0:
            time.sleep(3)
        continue
```

**b. On final failure, save to a dedicated outbox.** Don't reuse `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/` — that's the scheduler's log dir and gets confused with run records. Use `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/` (one subdir per delivery platform: `toutiao/`, `wechat/`, `email/`):

```python
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime
outbox = Path("/home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao")
outbox.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
ts = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M")
fname = outbox / f"{ts}_{topic['direction']}.html"
fname.write_text(full_html, encoding="utf-8")
return False, f"{last_err} (重试2次仍失败，HTML已备份: {fname})"
```

**c. Tell the user where the backup is in the failure message.** The whole point is that today's content isn't lost while the credential gets fixed. Embed the absolute path in the script's stderr so the failure report can show "HTML saved to /home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/20260825_2031_亲戚恩怨.html" and the user can open it.

**Working example**: `~/.hermes/cron/scripts/toutiao-article-daily.py::send_email()` after the 2026-08-25 fix — read it directly as the reference implementation.

### 7. Verify by triggering

```bash
cronjob(action='run', job_id='<job_id>')
# Wait a moment, then read the new log
ls -t ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/ | head -1 | xargs -I {} cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/{}
```

## Pitfalls

- **Headers lie, bodies don't.** A log can show `Status: script failed` but
  also contain the exact reason — read the body, not just the header line.

- **The script field is opaque.** The `cronjob` tool, `hermes cron list`, and
  the job-store JSON all show the script as you entered it. They do not tell
  you *how the scheduler will resolve it*. Always verify the resolved path
  yourself if a script-mode job is failing.

- **Profile context matters.** A no_agent script runs with HERMES_HOME pinned
  to the active profile's home. If you reference `~/.hermes/...` from inside
  such a script, it goes to the *profile* home, not the root home. Use
  `${HERMES_HOME}` env var or absolute paths inside cron scripts.

- **Scripts run with the scheduler's env, not your shell env.** Cron jobs do
  NOT inherit your interactive shell's PATH, alias, or sourced env vars. If
  a script depends on PATH, set PATH at the top of the script. If it needs
  `~/.ssh/jorge_server`, set the env var explicitly inside the script.

- **`hermes cron list` shows paused jobs only with `--all`.** A job you
  paused last week won't show in plain `cron list` and you'll waste an hour
  chasing a non-issue.

- **Multiple jobs can hit the same bug at once.** When one cron job's script
  path is wrong, check whether other jobs use the same path pattern — they
  almost certainly do. Fix all of them in one pass.

- **`cronjob(action='run')` runs once on the next tick, not immediately.**
  If you need synchronous verification, execute the script directly via
  terminal and read the log a moment later.

- **`Connection unexpectedly closed` is almost never a real network issue.**
  Python's `smtplib` reports the server's post-AUTH socket teardown as that
  generic error. The actual cause (535, rate limit, blocked port) is in the
  SMTP transcript one level deeper. Turn on `smtplib.SMTP.debuglevel = 1`
  and re-read the `reply:` lines before assuming connectivity is the problem.
  See the "SMTP / credential failure deep-dive" section for the full recipe.

- **Cron scripts do not inherit your interactive env vars.** A script that
  reads `os.environ['QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE']` will get an empty string in cron
  context, and your "I tested it manually and it worked" recollection is
  wrong because your shell *did* have the var set. Either bake the credential
  into `~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml`, or `export` it at the top of the
  script. See `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md` for a
  worked case study.

- **Once `probe_smtp.py` confirms a known auth-revocation pattern, stop re-running the script.** The credential is binary (valid or revoked), not probabilistic — re-running the full content-generation + SMTP-failure cycle produces zero new information, just more identical `❌ 发送失败: Connection unexpectedly closed` output that consumes cron-output bandwidth. After the first confirm, switch immediately to user-report mode (point at the outbox backup, give the fix command). See Case E in `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md`.

- **A failed email cron loses today's content unless you save it locally.**
  The script's `try/except` around `sendmail` swallows the error and exits
  cleanly — the article is gone. Always save the rendered HTML/text to
  `~/.hermes/cron/output/<script>_<timestamp>.{html,txt}` BEFORE attempting
  delivery, so a credential outage doesn't also nuke the work product.
  See "Step 4 — Save locally as a fallback" in the SMTP deep-dive.

- **Provider-specific error codes are not interchangeable.** QQ's `535` is
  a generic auth/account-abnormal message; Gmail is more specific; Outlook
  /Office365 adds a `5.7.606` error code you'll need to look up. Don't try
  to pattern-match across providers — read the full error string the first
  time.

- **Save AFTER failure, not only BEFORE send.** The Step 4 pattern (write
  HTML to disk before calling send_email) covers the "script crashes mid-
  delivery" case, but the common SMTP failure is the script completing
  cleanly with the article still in memory. A second backup at the catch-
  block tail catches BOTH the "credential died" and "network blip" paths
  without a wasted write on success. Combine: one retry on transient
  `SMTPServerDisconnected` (3s backoff), then save to
  `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/` on final failure with the absolute
  path embedded in the error message. See step 6 of the SMTP deep-dive for
  the working template from `toutiao-article-daily.py`.

- **The failure report must NOT depend on the broken channel.** When the
  cron is failing because of email, the failure report cannot be an email.
  Always check the cron's `deliver` config: if it's `deliver: origin` to
  Feishu/Lark/Slack, the agent's final response auto-delivers there and
  the failure report can ride that channel safely. If no `deliver` is
  configured, write the failure report into
  `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/README.md` alongside the HTML backups
  so the user finds it when they next inspect the outbox. See Case F in
  `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md` for the canonical
  report template.

- **Escalate to explicit user-facing fix instructions after the 3rd
  consecutive identical failure.** The first 1–2 occurrences: confirm with
  `probe_smtp.py`, save the outbox backup, and report minimally. From the
  3rd occurrence onward: include the verbatim QQ-web-UI fix steps
  (mail.qq.com → 设置 → 账户 → regenerate SMTP authorization code →
  update `~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml`) in the report, plus the
  cumulative failure count. By day 5+, the report should read like a
  runbook entry, not a passive error message — the user has likely been
  ignoring the first two.

- **At 10+ consecutive identical failures, stop running `probe_smtp.py`.**
  The credential state hasn't changed in a week; running the probe again
  consumes tokens to confirm what `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/README.md`
  already says. Skip straight to: outbox path + auth code location + the
  one-line fix. The user knows — they just haven't done it. Treat it like
  a runbook dispatch, not an investigation. See Case H for the canonical
  terse report template.

- **`crontab.txt` and Hermes `jobs.json` are independent schedulers.** Some
  deployments run the same script under both classic cron (`crontab -l` →
  `~/.hermes/cron/crontab.txt`) AND the Hermes cron scheduler (`jobs.json`).
  When debugging a "silent" cron, check both — `jobs.json` may show the job
  exists but not actually be the one firing, or vice versa. The log dir
  `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/` only exists for Hermes-scheduler runs.

- **Use a dedicated `outbox/` tree, not the scheduler's `output/` tree.**
  `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/` is the scheduler's own log directory;
  dropping backup artifacts there blurs "script ran" records with
  "content the user can still read" records, and the auto-rotation / log
  cleaners may eat your backups. Use `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/`
  with one subdir per delivery platform (`toutiao/`, `wechat/`,
  `unified/`, `email/`) and a `README.md` in each explaining the most
  recent outage + the user-facing fix (regenerate QQ auth code, etc.).

- **Two-source-of-truth can both be stale.** When `config.yaml`'s `smtp_pass`
  and `~/.hermes/.env`'s `QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE` were copied from the same QQ
  authorization code at setup time, a single revocation leaves BOTH dead.
  Just updating one won't help. Diff both against the live QQ web UI value
  before deciding the YAML is the canonical source. Pattern: `diff <(echo "$QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE") <(grep smtp_pass ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"')` — if they match, you only have one
  credential to regenerate, not two.

- **QQ silent-reject has no `535` reply in the transcript.** Unlike the
  documented case study, a QQ anti-spam that aggressively revokes an auth
  code may close the TLS socket right after `AUTH` with no `reply:` line at
  all — `debuglevel=1` shows a clean EHLO then a bare `SMTPServerDisconnected`.
  Don't conclude "network problem" just because the 535 is missing.
  See the "QQ Mail silent-reject variant" callout in the SMTP deep-dive.

## Cross-reference: known recurring outage

For the `toutiao-article-daily.py` QQ SMTP outage (10+ nights as of 2026-09-03, identical `Connection unexpectedly closed` every night, auth code `iylylmwnitbbbebi` revoked), see `references/toutiao-cron-outage-2026-08.md`. It contains the verbatim QQ-web-UI fix steps, the outbox cleanup recipe, and the terse-report pattern from Case H. **If you see a `Connection unexpectedly closed` on `smtp.qq.com:465` for `569545015@qq.com`, read that file first — the credential is almost certainly already revoked and the outbox already has today's content.**

## Case G — Agent-mode cron variant: 7th consecutive failure, outbox accumulation, importlib bypass (2026-09-02)

The `toutiao-article-daily.py` cron failed for the 7th consecutive night with the identical `Connection unexpectedly closed` symptom on the identical `iylylmwnitbbbebi` auth code. By this point the diagnostic is fully internalized. What was genuinely new this cycle:

### Agent-mode vs no_agent script-mode crons

The cron-job entry in `jobs.json` shows `no_agent: false` and `script: null` — meaning the cron triggers an **agent run with a prompt**, not direct script execution. The agent's prompt is `"运行 ~/.hermes/cron/scripts/toutiao-article-daily.py 生成当日头条文章..."`. Inside the agent, the script gets imported/run like any other Python. Two practical consequences:

1. **The agent can self-debug by re-invoking the script directly** — run `python3 ~/.hermes/cron/scripts/toutiao-article-daily.py` from the agent's terminal to reproduce the failure with full control.
2. **The cron-output → user-message pipeline IS the delivery surface.** When `deliver: origin` is set (e.g. to Feishu/Lark topic), the agent's final response auto-routes there. So the failure report rides that same channel — and it MUST contain the outbox path + the fix command verbatim, because the email channel is broken.

### Importlib bypass technique: regenerate content without burning SMTP

When you want to inspect what a cron script produces (for the report) without burning another failed SMTP attempt, use `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` to import the script as a module and call `main()` directly. The script's SMTP will still run (Python's `__name__` guard fires only on direct execution, not on importlib), so wrap by stubbing `send_email` BEFORE `exec_module`:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("toutiao_mod", "/home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/scripts/toutiao-article-daily.py")
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
def fake_send_email(html, plain, topic, micro):
    print(f"[FAKE] subject={topic['title']}, html_len={len(html)}")
    return True, "FAKE"
mod.send_email = fake_send_email       # override BEFORE exec_module
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)            # NOW the top-level code's send_email reference resolves to fake
html, plain, topic, micro = mod.main()
```

**Pitfall:** the `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` guard does NOT fire when loaded via importlib. Top-level code (including decorators and immediate `main()` calls if any) WILL execute on import. If the script calls `main()` outside the guard, you will get a second content-generation + failed-SMTP cycle. Check the script's top level first; if it has the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, you're safe.

A cleaner alternative: **import the module, then call only the generation functions explicitly** without invoking `main()`:

```python
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
# Don't call mod.main() — call the generators directly
html, plain, topic = mod.generate_article()
micro = mod.generate_micro_articles()
# Skip mod.send_email() entirely
```

This avoids the guard pitfall AND avoids the second SMTP attempt.

### Outbox accumulation pattern: 7+ days of identical failures

By day 7+, `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/` has accumulated ~10 HTML files (one per night, all ~27 KB, all generated by the same script with different topic directions). This is **correct behavior** — the script does exactly what Case C designed it to do. But the user eventually needs to clean these up after the credential is fixed. The recommended cleanup recipe:

```bash
# After the user regenerates the QQ auth code and confirms a clean run:
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/$(date +%Y-%m)_archive
# Move all-but-the-most-recent into the archive
ls -t ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/*.html | tail -n +2 | \
  xargs -I {} mv {} ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/$(date +%Y-%m)_archive/
# Append a one-line outage summary to outbox/README.md so future sessions see it
cat >> ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/README.md <<EOF
## Outage 2026-08-28 → 2026-09-02 (7 nights)
- Symptom: Connection unexpectedly closed on smtp.qq.com:465 (QQ silent-reject Case B)
- Root cause: SMTP authorization code iylylmwnitbbbebi revoked by QQ anti-spam
- Fix applied: user regenerated auth code in QQ web UI, updated ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml
- Verified: cron at 20:30 next night returned ✅ 邮件发送成功
EOF
```

The README's outage log is the **durable memory** for "what happened during this stretch" — survives across cron-job-script edits and config changes. Future sessions encountering the same auth code + same failure can grep `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/README.md` to confirm whether the current outage has been seen before.

### Outage detection via outbox age

A useful diagnostic shortcut for any future "is the SMTP broken right now?" question:

```bash
# How many nights has the outbox been growing without a successful cron?
ls -1 ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/*.html | wc -l
# Count of consecutive failed nights = (today - oldest_outbox_file_date)
# If ≥3, switch immediately to user-fix mode per the Case F decision rule.
```

## Case H — 10th consecutive identical SMTP failure: terse runbook dispatch mode (2026-09-03)

The `toutiao-article-daily.py` cron failed for the 10th consecutive night (since 2026-08-25). Same auth code (`iylylmwnitbbbebi`), same `Connection unexpectedly closed`, same `535 Login fail` in the SMTP transcript. Every diagnostic step from Cases A–G has been confirmed multiple times. New lesson this cycle: **the report should shrink, not grow, as the failure count climbs.**

### What NOT to do at failure N≥10

- Re-run `probe_smtp.py` — confirms what we already know, burns tokens.
- Re-explain what `535 Login fail` means — user has seen it 9 times.
- Re-list the full SMTP deep-dive steps — they're in this skill, the user knows.
- Suggest "try port 587 instead" — already covered in Case A; the credential is binary dead, transport won't help.
- Paste the full article HTML inline — the outbox already has it.

### What to do at failure N≥10

Compress the failure report to four lines:

```
📋 头条文章日报（N天连续失败）
✅ 内容生成成功 → outbox/toutiao/20260903_2030_赡养义务.html
❌ 邮件未送达：QQ SMTP 535 Login fail（同 iylylmwnitbbbebi 第N天）
🔧 修复：mail.qq.com → 账户 → SMTP服务 → 重新生成授权码 → 写回 ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml
```

That's it. No probe, no transcript dump, no alternative-transport suggestion. The user knows what to do; they're either (a) traveling / away from QQ web UI, (b) deferred it as low priority, or (c) genuinely forgot. The terse reminder with a concrete fix command is the highest-value response.

### Outbox count = silent outage clock

`ls ~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/ | grep -c '\.html$'` is now the canonical "how broken is SMTP right now" indicator. The count grows by 1 per failed night, freezes when fixed. If the count is ≥7 and the README.md has no "Outage resolved" entry, the outage is live. Use this to skip Step 1 of the diagnostic loop entirely — go straight to report.

## Diagnostic commands cheatsheet

```bash
# List all jobs including paused
hermes cron list --all

# Check scheduler status
hermes cron status

# View the newest log for a job
LATEST=$(ls -t ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/ | head -1)
cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/$LATEST

# Find where a script actually lives
find ~/.hermes -name 'skill-backup.sh' -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check expected vs actual scheduler resolution
echo "Expected: ${HOME}/.hermes/scripts/<script-field-as-stored>"
test -f "${HOME}/.hermes/scripts/<script-field-as-stored>" && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"

# Trigger the job manually
hermes cron run <job_id>

# Tail the most recent output file across all jobs
tail -n 20 ~/.hermes/cron/output/*/*.md | head -50
```

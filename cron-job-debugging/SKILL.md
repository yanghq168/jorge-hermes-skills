# Cron Job Debugging

Hermes cron jobs can fail silently — the scheduler writes a markdown report to
`~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<timestamp>.md`, but nothing surfaces in the
main conversation until the user notices a job isn't delivering. This skill
covers the diagnostic loop and the most common fixes.

## When to use

Load this skill when the user reports any of:
- "My scheduled job isn't running"
- "The [X] cron is failing"
- "I never got the [daily/weekly] digest"
- A no-agent script-mode job that was supposed to run at a specific time but produced nothing
- A scheduler output log file with `Status: script failed`

## The diagnostic loop (5 steps)

When a cron job is misbehaving, always run this loop in order. Don't skip
straight to "the script must be broken" — Hermes cron has its own failure
modes that don't surface until you read the output log.

### 1. List jobs and find the ID

```bash
hermes cron list
# or for cronjob tool user: cronjob(action='list')
```

Record the `job_id` (e.g. `077158d603ec`) and the configured `schedule`.

### 2. Read the most recent output log

Output logs are the source of truth for silent failures:

```bash
ls ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/ | tail -5
cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<most-recent>.md
```

The log header always includes:
- `Job ID`, `Run Time`, `Mode` (agent vs `no_agent (script)`), `Status`

If `Status: script failed`, the **body of the log is the error message** — don't
just glance at the header.

### 3. Decode the common errors

| Log body | Meaning | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `Script not found: <path>` | Scheduler couldn't find the script | See "Script-path resolution" below |
| (empty body, agent mode) | The LLM hit an error before producing output | Re-run with `cronjob(action='run')` and watch stderr |
| Non-zero exit code | Script crashed | Run the script manually to see the traceback |
| (no log file at all) | Job didn't tick — scheduler down or paused | `hermes cron status` |
| Log says success but delivery failed | Job ran but couldn't reach the target | Check `delivery` config + target chat/channel |
| `Connection unexpectedly closed` / `SMTPServerDisconnected` | Almost always a **credential/transport failure**, not a network blip | See "SMTP/credential failure deep-dive" below |
| `535 Login fail` / `535 Authentication failed` | SMTP auth code / password is wrong or expired | See "SMTP/credential failure deep-dive" below |

### 4. Apply the Script-path resolution rule

**The most common silent-failure cause.** When you create or update a cron job
with `script=some/relative/path.sh`, the scheduler resolves it relative to
`~/.hermes/scripts/` (the Hermes scripts dir), NOT the directory the script
lives in. So a script at `~/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh` entered as
`script="cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh"` is looked for at
`~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh` — which doesn't exist.

Diagnose by computing the expected path the scheduler uses and comparing it
to where the script actually lives:

```bash
HERMES_SCRIPTS="${HOME}/.hermes/scripts"
SCHED_PATH="$HERMES_SCRIPTS/<what-you-entered-as-script-field>"
ACTUAL="$(find ~/.hermes -name '<script-name>' -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
echo "Scheduler looks at: $SCHED_PATH"
echo "Script actually at: $ACTUAL"
```

**Three fixes, pick whichever is cleanest for the deployment:**

1. **Change the cron job's `script` field to the absolute path** (preferred —
   survives refactors):
   ```python
   cronjob(action='update', job_id='<id>', script='/home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh')
   ```
2. **Symlink the scheduler's expected path to the real one:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts
   ln -sf /home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh \
          ~/.hermes/scripts/cron/scripts/skill-backup.sh
   ```
3. **Move the script to the scheduler's expected location** (only if option 1
   and 2 don't fit).

Always re-run the job once after the fix:
```bash
hermes cron run <job_id>
cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/<newest>.md   # confirm success
```

### 5. SMTP / credential failure deep-dive (delivery-side silent failures)

The other common silent-failure class: the script runs, prints `❌ 发送失败: Connection unexpectedly closed`, exits 0 — and nothing reaches the inbox. The cryptic "connection closed" hides the real cause (almost always auth).

**The trap**: Python's `smtplib` re-raises the server's *post-AUTH* socket teardown as a generic `SMTPServerDisconnected("Connection unexpectedly closed")`. The real rejection is buried in the server transcript a few lines earlier. You cannot see it from the script's stdout.

**Step 1 — Reproduce with debug output to surface the real error:**

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/cron/scripts
python3 -c "
import smtplib, socket
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
socket.setdefaulttimeout(30)
smtplib.SMTP.debuglevel = 1
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('<smtp_server>', 465, timeout=30) as s:
    s.login('<user>', '<pass>')
    s.sendmail('<user>', '<to>', 'Subject: t\n\ntest')
"
```

Look at the `reply:` lines. The smoking gun is one of:

- `535 Login fail. Account is abnormal, service is not open, password is incorrect, login frequency limited...` — **auth code/password is wrong, expired, or service not enabled**. Cannot be fixed remotely; user must log into the mail provider's web UI and regenerate.
- `550 Mailbox not found` / `User not found` — recipient address wrong, or sender not authorized to send as that address.
- `554 DT:SPM ...` (QQ specific) — message body rejected as spam; shorten subject, remove URL shorteners, or fix plain-text/HTML mismatch.
- `454 4.7.0 Too many login attempts` — rate-limited; back off and try later, or stop running the script from multiple places.

**⚠️ QQ Mail silent-reject variant (no 535 in transcript):** When QQ's anti-spam system has aggressively revoked an auth code, the server may close the TLS socket IMMEDIATELY after `AUTH` with NO `reply:` line at all — `debuglevel=1` will show a clean `EHLO 250` then a bare `SMTPServerDisconnected` with no `535` between them. This is indistinguishable from a network drop except by the pattern: SSL handshake + EHLO succeed + AUTH never gets a reply → credential revoked by aggressive anti-spam (not just expired). Same user fix (regenerate in QQ web UI), but the diagnostic signature is different — don't conclude "network issue" just because the 535 line is missing. Confirm by trying port 587 STARTTLS as well: if EHLO succeeds there too and AUTH dies silently, it's the same silent-reject. If port 587 hangs at connect, you have a real firewall/network problem instead.

**Faster path — run `scripts/probe_smtp.py`** instead of retyping the debuglevel recipe. It auto-detects which credential sources this Hermes deployment uses (`config.yaml` + `~/.hermes/.env`), runs both 465-SSL and 587-STARTTLS probes, and reports which of the three failure modes you're in: 535-in-transcript (Case A), no-reply-silent-reject (Case B), or connect-time failure (Case C). Exit 0 = auth dead, exit 1 = real network problem. See `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md` for the full Case B transcript.

**Step 2 — Verify the credential actually matches what's stored.** Cron scripts read from `~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml` (via the standard `config_loader.py`). They do NOT inherit your interactive shell's env vars. So if your working theory is "the env-var auth code works but the YAML one doesn't" — check both:

```bash
# What's in the config file
grep -A1 smtp_pass ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml
# What's in the env (if the script reads os.environ)
env | grep -iE "smtp|auth_code|mail_pass"
# Which one is the script actually using?
grep -nE "smtp_pass|os\.environ|SMTP_PASS" ~/.hermes/cron/scripts/<script>.py | head
```

In Hermes' standard pattern (`from config_loader import get_mail_config`), the YAML wins over env. If both are wrong, the fix is the YAML; env vars are only a fallback inside the `try/except ImportError` block.

**Step 3 — Try the alternate transport.** Port 465 (SMTPS/SSL) and port 587 (STARTTLS) are independent — one can be blocked by the host firewall while the other works. If 465 fails, retry with `smtplib.SMTP('host', 587)` + `.starttls()`. If both fail with the same `535`, the credential is dead regardless of transport.

**Step 4 — Save locally as a fallback so today's content isn't lost.** While waiting for the user to fix the credential, persist the generated output so the article/digest is still recoverable:

```python
# Inside the cron script's main(), BEFORE send_email(), or in a wrapper:
import os
from datetime import datetime
out_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/output')
os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok=True)
ts = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M')
with open(f'{out_dir}/<script>_{ts}.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(full_html)
with open(f'{out_dir}/<script>_{ts}.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(plain_text)
```

Then in the failure report, point the user at the saved file. This is the difference between "today's content is gone" and "today's content is on disk, please fix auth."

### 6. Tiered fallback: retry transient, then save locally on hard failure

Step 4's "save before send" is the right pattern for content that takes a long time to generate. But most cron scripts already have the content in memory by the time they call `send_email()`, and saving-then-attempting-then-re-saving-on-failure is two writes of the same bytes. A tighter pattern that works well in practice:

**a. Retry transient `SMTPServerDisconnected` once with a 3s backoff.** Most 535 / socket-teardown failures are NOT transient — but a real network blip looks identical to a credential failure from the script's side. One cheap retry distinguishes them and recovers the rare real-blip case without hiding real auth failures.

```python
import time
last_err = None
for attempt in range(2):
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, timeout=15) as server:
            server.login(SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS)
            server.sendmail(SMTP_USER, TO_EMAIL, msg.as_string())
        return True, "发送成功"
    except (smtplib.SMTPServerDisconnected, smtplib.SMTPException, OSError) as e:
        last_err = e
        if attempt == 0:
            time.sleep(3)
        continue
```

**b. On final failure, save to a dedicated outbox.** Don't reuse `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/` — that's the scheduler's log dir and gets confused with run records. Use `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/` (one subdir per delivery platform: `toutiao/`, `wechat/`, `email/`):

```python
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime
outbox = Path("/home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao")
outbox.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
ts = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M")
fname = outbox / f"{ts}_{topic['direction']}.html"
fname.write_text(full_html, encoding="utf-8")
return False, f"{last_err} (重试2次仍失败，HTML已备份: {fname})"
```

**c. Tell the user where the backup is in the failure message.** The whole point is that today's content isn't lost while the credential gets fixed. Embed the absolute path in the script's stderr so the failure report can show "HTML saved to /home/ubuntu/.hermes/cron/outbox/toutiao/20260825_2031_亲戚恩怨.html" and the user can open it.

**Working example**: `~/.hermes/cron/scripts/toutiao-article-daily.py::send_email()` after the 2026-08-25 fix — read it directly as the reference implementation.

### 7. Verify by triggering

```bash
cronjob(action='run', job_id='<job_id>')
# Wait a moment, then read the new log
ls -t ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/ | head -1 | xargs -I {} cat ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/{}
```

## Pitfalls

- **Headers lie, bodies don't.** A log can show `Status: script failed` but
  also contain the exact reason — read the body, not just the header line.

- **The script field is opaque.** The `cronjob` tool, `hermes cron list`, and
  the job-store JSON all show the script as you entered it. They do not tell
  you *how the scheduler will resolve it*. Always verify the resolved path
  yourself if a script-mode job is failing.

- **Profile context matters.** A no_agent script runs with HERMES_HOME pinned
  to the active profile's home. If you reference `~/.hermes/...` from inside
  such a script, it goes to the *profile* home, not the root home. Use
  `${HERMES_HOME}` env var or absolute paths inside cron scripts.

- **Scripts run with the scheduler's env, not your shell env.** Cron jobs do
  NOT inherit your interactive shell's PATH, alias, or sourced env vars. If
  a script depends on PATH, set PATH at the top of the script. If it needs
  `~/.ssh/jorge_server`, set the env var explicitly inside the script.

- **`hermes cron list` shows paused jobs only with `--all`.** A job you
  paused last week won't show in plain `cron list` and you'll waste an hour
  chasing a non-issue.

- **Multiple jobs can hit the same bug at once.** When one cron job's script
  path is wrong, check whether other jobs use the same path pattern — they
  almost certainly do. Fix all of them in one pass.

- **`cronjob(action='run')` runs once on the next tick, not immediately.**
  If you need synchronous verification, execute the script directly via
  terminal and read the log a moment later.

- **`Connection unexpectedly closed` is almost never a real network issue.**
  Python's `smtplib` reports the server's post-AUTH socket teardown as that
  generic error. The actual cause (535, rate limit, blocked port) is in the
  SMTP transcript one level deeper. Turn on `smtplib.SMTP.debuglevel = 1`
  and re-read the `reply:` lines before assuming connectivity is the problem.
  See the "SMTP / credential failure deep-dive" section for the full recipe.

- **Cron scripts do not inherit your interactive env vars.** A script that
  reads `os.environ['QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE']` will get an empty string in cron
  context, and your "I tested it manually and it worked" recollection is
  wrong because your shell *did* have the var set. Either bake the credential
  into `~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml`, or `export` it at the top of the
  script. See `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md` for a
  worked case study.

- **Once `probe_smtp.py` confirms a known auth-revocation pattern, stop re-running the script.** The credential is binary (valid or revoked), not probabilistic — re-running the full content-generation + SMTP-failure cycle produces zero new information, just more identical `❌ 发送失败: Connection unexpectedly closed` output that consumes cron-output bandwidth. After the first confirm, switch immediately to user-report mode (point at the outbox backup, give the fix command). See Case E in `references/smtp-credential-failure-case-study.md`.

- **A failed email cron loses today's content unless you save it locally.**
  The script's `try/except` around `sendmail` swallows the error and exits
  cleanly — the article is gone. Always save the rendered HTML/text to
  `~/.hermes/cron/output/<script>_<timestamp>.{html,txt}` BEFORE attempting
  delivery, so a credential outage doesn't also nuke the work product.
  See "Step 4 — Save locally as a fallback" in the SMTP deep-dive.

- **Provider-specific error codes are not interchangeable.** QQ's `535` is
  a generic auth/account-abnormal message; Gmail is more specific; Outlook
  /Office365 adds a `5.7.606` error code you'll need to look up. Don't try
  to pattern-match across providers — read the full error string the first
  time.

- **Save AFTER failure, not only BEFORE send.** The Step 4 pattern (write
  HTML to disk before calling send_email) covers the "script crashes mid-
  delivery" case, but the common SMTP failure is the script completing
  cleanly with the article still in memory. A second backup at the catch-
  block tail catches BOTH the "credential died" and "network blip" paths
  without a wasted write on success. Combine: one retry on transient
  `SMTPServerDisconnected` (3s backoff), then save to
  `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/` on final failure with the absolute
  path embedded in the error message. See step 6 of the SMTP deep-dive for
  the working template from `toutiao-article-daily.py`.

- **Use a dedicated `outbox/` tree, not the scheduler's `output/` tree.**
  `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/` is the scheduler's own log directory;
  dropping backup artifacts there blurs "script ran" records with
  "content the user can still read" records, and the auto-rotation / log
  cleaners may eat your backups. Use `~/.hermes/cron/outbox/<platform>/`
  with one subdir per delivery platform (`toutiao/`, `wechat/`,
  `unified/`, `email/`) and a `README.md` in each explaining the most
  recent outage + the user-facing fix (regenerate QQ auth code, etc.).

- **Two-source-of-truth can both be stale.** When `config.yaml`'s `smtp_pass`
  and `~/.hermes/.env`'s `QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE` were copied from the same QQ
  authorization code at setup time, a single revocation leaves BOTH dead.
  Just updating one won't help. Diff both against the live QQ web UI value
  before deciding the YAML is the canonical source. Pattern: `diff <(echo "$QQ_EMAIL_AUTH_CODE") <(grep smtp_pass ~/.hermes/cron/config/config.yaml | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"')` — if they match, you only have one
  credential to regenerate, not two.

- **QQ silent-reject has no `535` reply in the transcript.** Unlike the
  documented case study, a QQ anti-spam that aggressively revokes an auth
  code may close the TLS socket right after `AUTH` with no `reply:` line at
  all — `debuglevel=1` shows a clean EHLO then a bare `SMTPServerDisconnected`.
  Don't conclude "network problem" just because the 535 is missing.
  See the "QQ Mail silent-reject variant" callout in the SMTP deep-dive.
